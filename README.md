# Quilt Omnimod

Omnimod is my attempt to reduce the amount of projects I have to maintain
by taking all my ideas and putting them into one mod.

[Builds](https://github.com/halotroop2288/Omnimod/releases) are distributed with
a [custom fork](https://github.com/halotroop2288/NoIndium) of *No Indium?* built in.
This will warn you when you have a problematic mod installed, or are missing a compatibility plugin between two mods.
